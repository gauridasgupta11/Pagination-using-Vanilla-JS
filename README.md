# Pagination-using-Vanilla-JS

This repo is an example of how to implement pagination using vanilla javascript. 

The main.js consists of a dataset (list) that is a generic list of 9 companies which are divided between 3 pages as our number of items per page is 3.

This is a "first, last, next, previous" type of pagination, not a numbered pagination (might check in some code in comments to add numbers to it in the future).
